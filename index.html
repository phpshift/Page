            World's first AI-powered full-stack framework? Every framework is

            <p>
              Well... you can use some AI tools to develop your code, but let's
              be specific: Today people might develop code with
              editor-integrated, non-framework-specific tools, or AI powered
              code editors, or platforms, or platform-offered subscription-based
              features... that often leads to irrelevant and unoptimized
              development as reported by developers.
            </p>
            <p>
              All these things are platforms, or editor-integrated
              non-framework-specific tools, or platform-offered
              subscription-based features.
            </p>
            <p>
              The statement “World's first AI-powered Full-Stack Framework” is
              correct for <strong>PHPShift</strong> because this is an entirely
              new, an actual framework with its own AI integration, and you
              don't need any additional tools anymore.

            <p>
              I have noticed this type of question in many YouTube videos about
              AI projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's be serious and realistic for a moment... First of all and
              Last of all, I prefer to spend my time working on the system that
              produces, not on its products. This is like oil extraction, not
              oil refining. So, please think about it and first, debug this type
              of question for yourself.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(2)">
            Will your creation replace developers?
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer" id="faq-answer-2">
            <p>
              With this framework, you will be able to activate an autopilot
              mode that takes control of your project's development. This
              framework is like a human body powered by a brain - if the brain
              is smart, the human works smart.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, the framework will become as smart as AI develops. However,
              you'll see that the framework is already intelligent enough to
              understand an entire project and manage it.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have implemented algorithms that allow the framework to adapt
              itself and even expand its functionality based on user needs. This
              is similar to backpropagation used in AI systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              BUT, despite all these advantages and automations, at this stage
              of AI before AGI, human developers are still needed to manage the
              overall functionality of projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              To be honest, I don't know what will happen after AGI, but I
              believe this framework will still provide space for manual
              development, as you can also build without using AI. This decision
              is yours to make.
            </p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(3)">
            So, why not make it public on GitHub? What else is left to do?
          </button>

            </p>
            <p>
              Making the project public is always easy and just one click away.
              However, making such a decision without proper preparation and
              addressing specific needs, could have long-term impacts and is
              unwise for innovative projects like this.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rushing the release could compromise quality and stable
              development of the system.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, I am seeking a relevant U.S.-based major tech company
              to collaborate with and support me in addressing key needs that
              play a crucial role in launching this project globally.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have already listed several potential partners, so stay tuned -
              a full release could happen any day now.

                Mostly, I hear that developers hate this kind of AI softwares,
                because people think they will take their jobs.
                <strong>What happened?</strong> - Relatively smart engineers
                knew that AI would be involved in coding in the future, so they
                decided to be the first to create different types of AI code
                generators.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>However</strong>, the approaches they chose are
                optimized to generate more income in the short term, leveraging
                relevant business and marketing strategies and taking advantage
                of the moment when this type of software is new to the public,
                less regulated, and seems groundbreaking.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can use some AI tools to develop your code, but
                <strong>let's be specific</strong>: Today people might develop
                code with editor-integrated, non-framework-specific tools, or AI
                powered code editors, or platforms, or platform-offered
                subscription-based features... that often leads to irrelevant
                and unoptimized development as reported by developers.
              </p>
              <p>
                All these things are platforms, editors, or editor-integrated
                non-framework-specific tools, or platform-offered
                subscription-based features.
              </p>
              <p>
                But let's be realistic and think about the most relevant product
                that developers would like to use with pleasure,
                <strong>without hate or fear</strong> of being replaced by AI.
                Also, let's consider the track record of the
                <strong>most useful products</strong> that developers actually
                work with - Yes, <strong>FRAMEWORKS</strong>!
              </p>
              <p>
                Usually, frameworks are maintained by their creators with small
                teams and developed based on contributions. People use them due
                to the <strong>high accessibility</strong> of provided public
                resources and the specific services that maintainers offer.
              </p>
              <p>
                These are the exact reasons why people continue to use
                frameworks as the <strong>foundation</strong> for their
                projects. Even with the rise of AI tools known for assisting
                developers in coding, frameworks have remained the foundation of
                every project.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>So, my question to myself was</strong>: Why do we have
                to mix everything up just because some marketers of
                “well-funded” creators told us to? - What if there was a
                publicly accessible framework (with additional services) that
                had its own AI integration, highly optimized for this specific
                job?
              </p>
              <p>
                After some research, I discovered that popular frameworks today
                are overly complicated and too heavy for such integrations.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>So, I decided to create a new one</strong> - an actual
                full-stack framework with simplified concepts specifically
                designed to be easily
                <strong>manageable by both AI and humans</strong>, featuring its
                own AI integration.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you think about it for a while, you'll realize that this
                AI-powered framework is a way to offer a
                <strong>long-term AI-driven development</strong> solution that
                developers will genuinely enjoy using. Moreover, it has the
                potential to easily outclass other similar products currently
                available.
              </p>
              <p>
                And the statement “World's first AI-powered full-stack
                framework” is correct because “PHPShift” is an entirely new, an
                actual framework with its own AI integration - Yes,
                <strong>you don't need any additional tools anymore</strong>.
